## Research Experience
**Research Assistant** — Prof. Franklin Qian, UNC-Chapel Hill (Mar 2025 — Present)  
- Engineered a large-scale data pipeline (Python, PostgreSQL, PostGIS) to process a 76-million-observation spatial dataset (40+ variables) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), using tools including BigQuery and Google Compute Engine (GCE).
- Computed spatially comparable housing variables across various ranges (e.g., 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 mile) based on specific time-window and other property-related filtering criteria (e.g., age, living area), leveraging parallelized workflows to accelerate computation and system throughput (by ~50x).
- Reproduced the construction process for variable seller_experience and incorporated condition-based duplicate checks, finding a negligible 1.03% duplication rate.

**Independent Research** — The Impact of News Media Sentiment on Financial Markets (Jan 2025 — Present)  
- Fine-tuned an industry classifier (93.5% accuracy) using a pre-trained BERT model with multi-frequency data of news sentiment.
- Found that negative news sentiment strongly and negatively affects stock returns; high-tech industries react more quickly to news than traditional manufacturing; short-term impact is strong while long-term impact tends to weaken.

## Professional Experience
**VariFlight Technology** — Data Developer Intern (Jun 2025 — Aug 2025)  
- Utilized Python-based web scraping to gather public reports and webpages/images from CAAC. Employed OCR/image recognition tools (pytesseract, Camelot) to extract unstructured data from 600+ non-formatted PDFs and 500+ webpages and automated transfer into formatted CSVs for LLM training.

**Ernst & Young** — Consulting Intern, Financial Service Office (Dec 2022 — Feb 2023)
