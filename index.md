## TECHNICAL PROJECTS

### [cite_start]Performance Optimization of a Yield-to-Worst Solver [cite: 19]
* [cite_start]Assisted in completing the core functions related to risk detection for the computation module. [cite: 21]
* [cite_start]Designed a caching system to memorize high-frequency cash flow queries, solving the I/O bottleneck from redundant computations and yielding a 9x performance increase. [cite: 22]
* [cite_start]Rewrote the core yield-to-worst numerical solver using Numba JIT, reducing the computation time for a single bond from 1.57 ms to 7.5 μs, achieving a 210x speedup. [cite: 23]

### [cite_start]Jane Street Market Prediction Competition (Kaggle) [cite: 24]
* [cite_start]**Silver Medal (top 2.7%, Ranked 94th/3757)** [cite: 25]
* [cite_start]Conducted EDA (e.g., correlation analysis, visualization) on dataset to better understand hidden patterns. [cite: 26]
* [cite_start]Implemented features expansion on anonymized market data to obtain more information for training. [cite: 26]
* [cite_start]Trained multiple tree models and deep learning models, ensembled models for the best performance (NN, Ridge Regression, XGBoost and TabNet). [cite: 27]

### [cite_start]UCSD CSE 251B Class Competition 2025 [cite: 29]
* [cite_start]**Trajectory Prediction Challenge (Using Argoverse 2 Motion Forecasting Dataset)** [cite: 30, 31]
* [cite_start]Performed data preprocessing, especially data augmentation on raw data, including 50% probability coordinate rotation, flipping, and Gaussian noise addition. [cite: 32]
* [cite_start]Architected a OneStepLSTM model with rolling features adopted for autoregressive prediction, leading to a significant performance improvement (e.g., test metric improved from 10.22 to 8.50). [cite: 33]

### [cite_start]Text Analysis and Bert Fine-tuning on 10k reports [cite: 34]
* [cite_start]**MGTF 423 Final Project, UCSD** [cite: 35]
* [cite_start]Extracted unstructured text strings from raw reports, cleaned the text and stored the information in a standardized way. [cite: 36]
* [cite_start]Conducted an in-depth exploratory analysis of the cleaned text data extracted from 10k reports for Fluence Energy, Inc, from Y2022-Y2024. [cite: 37]
* [cite_start]Fine-tuned BERT model based on a cleaned dataset, including 20.5 million rows of text strings extracted from 10k reports (SEC). [cite: 38]

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### [cite_start]Research Assistant for Professor Franklin Qian, UNC-Chapel Hill (Mar 2025 - Present) [cite: 41, 42, 43]
* [cite_start]**The Numbers Game: Effects of Listing and Counteroffer Pricing Format in Housing Bargaining** [cite: 44]
* [cite_start]Engineered a large-scale data pipeline (Python, PostgreSQL, PostGIS) to process a 76-million-observation spatial dataset (40+ variables) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), using tools including BigQuery and Google Compute Engine (GCE). [cite: 45]
* [cite_start]Computed spatially comparable housing variables across various ranges (e.g., 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 mile) based on specific time-window and other property-related filtering criteria, leveraging parallelized workflows to accelerate computation (by 50x, approximately). [cite: 46]
* [cite_start]Reproduced the construction process for variable seller experience and incorporated condition-based duplicate checks, finding a negligible 1.03% duplication rate. [cite: 47]

### [cite_start]Independent Research (Jan 2025 - Present) [cite: 48, 50, 51]
* [cite_start]**The Impact of News Media Sentiment on Financial Markets** [cite: 49]
* [cite_start]Fine-tuned an industry classifier (93.5% accuracy) using a pre-trained BERT model with multi-frequency data of news sentiment. [cite: 52]
* [cite_start]Found that negative news sentiment strongly and negatively affects stock returns and that high-tech industries react more quickly to news than traditional manufacturing. [cite: 53]
